# Welcome to my first MDX blog post!

This is an example of a blog post written in MDX. MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents.

With MDX, you can import components and use them within your content. This makes it easy to create interactive and dynamic blog posts.

Here's an example of using a component within an MDX post:

```jsx
import { MyComponent } from "../components/MyComponent";

<MyComponent />;
```
